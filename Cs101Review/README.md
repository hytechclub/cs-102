# <span>Introductions & C# 101 Review</span>
For the first session, establish the classroom environment and start reviewing the concepts from C# 101.

## Icebreaker
The first session should begin with a quick icebreaker activity where the instructors and students can introduce themselves.

### Virtual Icebreaker
Complete a virtual activity to allow the students to get to know each other, and encourage them to share their screen/mic/video. One possibility is to have each student go to [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) and have them draw something. Then, go around the room and have each student introduce their drawing by sharing their screen.

### Virtual Icebreaker Game
Break out into a couple different rooms, and create new private rooms in [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io). Keep the round count and draw time to small numbers to limit the total amount of time for the activity. In the "Custom Words" text area, add some C#-related words that the students should recognize from C# 101. For example:

```
C#, variable, conditional, if, else, while, loop, method, return, parameter, argument, console, int, string, boolean, data, type, semi-colon, parenthesis, dot, quotes, write, read
```

Play the games with the students! At the end of the activity, group back up in the main Zoom room.

## Illustrator Code-Along
Walk through the [Illustrator Code-Along](IllustratorCodeAlong.md) with the students. Make sure to ask review questions along the way.

## Basic Review Practice
After the code-along, allow the students to work on the [Basic Review Practice](BasicReviewPractice.md).

## Review Quiz
At the end of the session, play the [C# 101 Review Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/bb385c52-cb21-414b-8a66-ac27a468bf30). Make a note of any questions that the students struggle to answer, and make sure to emphasize those concepts when reviewing them further.
