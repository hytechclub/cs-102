# <span>C# 101 Review Continued</span>
Continue to review the concepts from C# 101, with a particular focus on methods.

## Warm-Up
Ask the students if there are any topics they would like to review. Keep the scope to output, input, variables, data types, `if` statements, `while` loops, and methods. All of these topics will be covered by the code-along and practice, but make sure to spend extra time on any topics that require extra attention.

## Boxifier Code-Along
Walk through the [Boxifier Code-Along](BoxifierCodeAlong.md) with the students. Make sure to ask review questions along the way.

## Method Review Practice
After the code-along, allow the students to work on the [Method Review Practice](MethodReviewPractice.md). If they did not complete the [practice from the previous session](../Cs101Review/BasicReviewPractice.md), they can work on that as well.

## Review Quiz
At the end of the session, replay the [C# 101 Review Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/bb385c52-cb21-414b-8a66-ac27a468bf30) from the previous session. Hopefully the students will be able to improve their scores.
