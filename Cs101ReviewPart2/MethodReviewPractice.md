## Choose Your Own Adventure
Create a [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)-style text-based game. Use methods to represent different story-lines and player choices. Use `Console.ReadLine` to receive input from the user, and `if` statements to determine which methods should be called.
