# Classes
Introduce classes.
 
## Warm Up
Programming often involves representing real-life concepts in code and data. Have students describe concepts in programming terms using variables/methods. Exact code is not necessary but can be a stretch goal. Have students share their ideas after a few minutes

Possible concepts:
- Cars
- Sports
- Animals
- Pokemon
- Clothing
- Food
- Games

## Classes Lecture
Introduce classes in C# as a way to represent **objects** that multiple pieces of data / functionality.

During the lecture, the students can follow along and build up a simple Console app. They should start from scratch on a new Repl. They should add a new `Dog.cs` file, and implement the `Dog` class in that file. There is a challenge in the lecture where they will implement a method on the Dog class.

## Movie Watchlist Code-Along
Go through the [Code-Along instructions](MovieWatchlistCodeAlong.md) with the students to show how classes can be useful in programs.

## Restaurant Review App Design Individual Exercise
The students should read through the [Individual exercise](RestaurantClass.md) and attempt to design a class for a Restaurant. They can also try to build an application around that class.
