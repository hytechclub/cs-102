Run the program and ensure that the message appears in the console.\nCode\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Illustrator!\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nPrinting the Menu\nNext, print out the menu for the application. It should start with another empty Console.WriteLine for some more space. It should then ask the user which command they would like to execute. To start, add one option for a command: \"1. Draw Bunny\". Add empty Console.WriteLine statements to make spaces between the messages where necessary. Run the program and ensure that the menu text appears as expected.\nCode\nConsole.WriteLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"What would you like to do?\");\nConsole.WriteLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"1. Draw Bunny\");\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nReceiving User Input\nOnce the user has been prompted, it is necessary to receive their input from the console.\n\nCreate a new string variable named command, and use Console.ReadLine to read the user's command from the console\nRepeat the command back to the user. For example, if they entered \"1\" as the command, the program should print \"You entered: 1\"\nAdd an empty Console.WriteLine to make some space\nRun the program, enter a command, and verify that it is properly remembered and repeated\n\nstring command = Console.ReadLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"You entered: \" + command);\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nExecuting the User Command\nNow that the command is known, it is time to execute it. Currently, it is only possible to execute one command: the \"1. Draw Bunny\" command. To start, print out the word \"bunny\" if the user entered \"1\" for the command.\n\nAfter the command is read from the user, add an if statement\nWithin the conditional for the if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"1\"\nIn the body of the if statement, use Console.WriteLine to write \"bunny\" to the console\nRun the program, and verify that \"bunny\" is printed if the command entered is \"1\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"1\")\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"bunny\");\n}\n\nUpdating the Bunny\nInstead of simply printing the word \"bunny\" to the console, the program should draw an ASCII art bunny. Use three Console.WriteLine statements to draw a bunny. Run the program to see the new bunny!\nCode\nConsole.WriteLine(\"() ()\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"(^ ^)\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"(___)\");\n\nAdding Another Command\nSo far, the program is not all that interesting. It can only execute one command! Add some code so that the program can execute another command: \"2. Draw Fish\"\n\nIn the menu section, add another Console.WriteLine to print out \"Draw Fish\" option: Console.WriteLine(\"2. Draw Fish\");\n\n\nUnder the existing if statement, create a new if statement\nIn this if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"2\"\nIn the body of this if statement, write code to print out a small ASCII fish\nRun the program, and verify that the fish is printed if the command entered is \"2\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"2\")\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"  _ \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\">\");\n}\n\nLooping the Process Infinitely\nCurrently, the program will run once, and then exit. However, to be a true menu-based application, the program should load the menu repetitively. Use a while loop to accomplish this.\n\nFind the first empty Console.WriteLine statement, above the one that says \"What would you like to do?\"\nRight above that statement, create a while loop\nSet the condition of the while loop to be true\nThis means the while loop will repeat infinitely!\n\n\nAdd the opening curly bracket immediately after the closing parenthesis for the while loop\nFind the end of the second if statement, and add the closing curly bracket for the while loop immediately following it\nIndent the code within the while loop so it is easier to read\nRun the program, and verify that the menu continuously re-appears!\n\nCode\nwhile (true)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"What would you like to do?\");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"1. Draw Bunny\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"2. Draw Fish\");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    string command = Console.ReadLine();\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    if (command == \"1\")\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"() ()\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"(^ ^)\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"(___)\");\n    }\n\n    if (command == \"2\")\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"  _ \");\n        Console.WriteLine(\">\");\n    }\n}\n\nAdding an Exit Command\nTo ensure that the program does not actually run forever, add an additional \"3. Exit\" command.\n\nIn the menu section, add another Console.WriteLine to print out \"Exit\" option: Console.WriteLine(\"3. Exit\");\n\n\nUnder the existing if statement, create a new if statement\nIn this if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"3\"\nIn the body of this if statement, add a break command that will break out of the while loop\nRun the program, and verify that the program exits if the command entered is \"2\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"3\")\n{\n    break;\n}\n\nFinal Code\n\nRepl\n\n"},"Cs101Review/BasicReviewPractice.html":{"url":"Cs101Review/BasicReviewPractice.html","title":"Basic Review Practice","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review: Basic Practice\nFollow the instructions to review some basic C# concepts.\nIllustrator Enhancements\nAfter completing the Illustrator Code-Along, make the following enhancements:\n\nAdd more command options to draw more ASCII art!\nCheck out this guide for help making ASCII art and using it in C#\n\n\n(BONUS) Instead of using if statements to run the commands, use a switch statement\n(BONUS) Define a method for each command, and call each method based on the user's selection\n\nFind the Bugs\nVisit each of the following Repls, and fix the errors in them.\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\n\nMulti-Page Story\nOften when reading something on a computer, the program will contain multiple pages instead of showing all the text at once. Create a C# application that will display a story, one passage at a time. It should end up looking something like this Frankenstein story by the end.\nUse Console.WriteLine to display the text from the story. Use Console.ReadLine to wait for the user to press Enter and continue. Use a while loop to loop through each passage of the story. Make sure to declare a counter variable to keep track of the current passage, and increment it every time through the loop.\nBonus Challenge - Word Breaking\nCurrently, using Console.WriteLine will add line breaks in the middle of words.\nFor example, it will show this:\nthe success of my und\nertaking.\nWhen it should show this:\nthe success of my\nundertaking.\nFix this by inserting a newline character (\\n) in the text for every place the line should break.\nBonus Bonus Challenge - Console Window Width\nTo make the newlines truly dynamic, measure the width of the console using Console.Window.Width. Use that value to determine where the newline characters should go. This way, it will properly keep words together regardless of the size of the console!\n"},"Cs101Review/AsciiArt.html":{"url":"Cs101Review/AsciiArt.html","title":"ASCII Art in C#","keywords":"","body":"ASCII Art in C#: Using Verbatim String Literals\nIt's a lot of fun to create ASCII art in C#, but there are a few issues that can arise with certain characters.\nLet's say we want to create a bat. We found a decent-looking ASCII art bat online, and it looks like this:\n  _   ,_,   _\n / `'=) (='` \\\n/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \n`      \"      `\nNow, we try to put that in C# with the following code:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"  _   ,_,   _   \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\" / `'=) (='` \\  \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"`      '      ` \");\n\nLooks good, right? But when we try to run it, we get a bunch of errors! What's happening here?\nEscape Sequences\nThe problem is that C# is on the lookout for escape sequences. Every time it sees a backslash (\\), it thinks we are trying to create a special character! Our bat contains several backslashes, so it gets tripped up. What we want to do is avoid these escape sequences, and treat the backslashes as regular text. How can we do that?\nVerbatim String Literals\nVerbatim string literals are a way to tell C# that we don't want to use any escape sequences, we just want the raw text. Instead of giving us errors, or converting our backslash sequences to other symbols, it will keep the text as-is.\nTo create a verbatim string literal, simply add an @ before the opening quote! Returning to our bat example, here's all we have to do to make it work:\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"  _   ,_,   _   \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\" / `'=) (='` \\  \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"`      '      ` \");\n\nAnother great thing about verbatim strings is that we can easily combine multiple lines! Instead of using the four Console.WriteLine statements above, we can use one Console.WriteLine statement that contains each line for the bat. All we have to do is make a new line in between the opening and closing double quotes. Make sure not to indent any of the text; since it's verbatim, those extra spaces will be in the final text!\nIt should look something like this:\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"\n  _   ,_,   _   \n / `'=) (='` \\  \n/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\\n`      '      `\n\");\n\nUsing verbatim string literals makes it much easier to work with ASCII art. For more information about how to find and create ASCII art, check out this article. Just make sure to start your strings with an @ symbol!\n"},"Cs101ReviewPart2/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Cs101ReviewPart2/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 2 - C# 101 Review Continued","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review Continued\nContinue to review C# 101, with a focus on methods.

To start, have the method simply print out a box containing a static message.\nUnder the Main method, define a new method named boxify:\npublic static void boxify() { }\n\nThen, in the body of the boxify method, add three Console.WriteLine statements to print out the word \"Box\" surrounded by an ASCII art box:\nConsole.WriteLine(\".-------.\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"|  Box  |\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"*-------*\");\n\nFinally, call the boxify method from the Main method, under the other code:\nboxify();\n\nRun the program, and verify that the properly boxed message appears!\nReturning a string from the boxify Method\nTo make this more dynamic, the boxify method should return a string. This way, the code that calls the method can do anything with the result.\nStart by updating the method signature of the boxify method so that its return type is string instead of void:\npublic static string boxify()\n\nNext, in the body of the boxify method, move the three strings out of the Console.WriteLine statements, and into their own variables:\nstring topLine = \".-------.\";\nstring middleLine = \"|  Box  |\";\nstring bottomLine = \"*-------*\";\n\nFinally, combine the three string lines, separated by '\\n' characters, into a new string variable, and return it:\nstring entireBox = topLine + \"\\n\" + middleLine + \"\\n\" + bottomLine;\nreturn entireBox;\n\nUsing a Custom message Parameter for the boxify Method\nNow that the box message has been returned as a string, it's time to add the ability to customize the message. Instead of always putting \"Box\" in the box, the message will be determined by a parameter on the boxify method.\nFirst, update the method signature for the boxify method so that it contains a new string parameter of message:\npublic static string boxify(string message)\n\nThen, update the middleLine variable so that instead of containing \"Box\" it contains the custom message parameter\nstring middleLine = \"|  \" + message + \"  |\";\n\nEverything else should still work the same for now!\nUpdating the boxify Method Call with the string Argument\nThe boxify method has been updated quite a bit, but it appears to be broken when it is called from the Main method! This is because the boxify method takes an argument now, and the Main method needs to pass something into it.\nCreate a new string variable above the call to boxify, and pass it into the boxify method call:\nstring boxMessage = \"I am in a box\";\n\nboxify(boxMessage);\n\nAdditionally, it is important to save what is returned from the boxify method call! Create a new string variable named box, and update the code so that it stores the result in the variable:\nstring box = boxify(boxMessage);\n\nRun the code to make sure it works! It should look okay for some messages, but it also appears to be a little off.\nCalculating the Box Top and Bottom Dashes\nCurrently, the number of dashes on the top and the bottom of the box does not change with the message length. This means that the box does not look much like a box! Update the code in the boxify method so that it dynamically creates strings for the top and bottom dashes.\nAt the top of the body of the boxify method, create a new string variable named dashes, and set it to the empty string:\nstring dashes = \"\";\n\nThe dashes variable should eventually hold one dash for each character in the message. To accomplish this, set up a while loop:\nwhile ()\n{\n\n}\n\nIn the condition for the while loop, check that the length of dashes is less than the length of message:\nwhile (dashes.Length \nBasically, the loop should continue until the number of dashes matches the number of characters in the message. Next, in the body of the while loop, add a dash to the dashes variable:\ndashes += \"-\";\n\nNow that the proper dashes have been calculated, it's time to place them within the topLine and bottomLine variables. Remove the three - characters currently in the middle of the top and bottom lines, and replace them with the dashes variable:\nstring topLine = \".--\" + dashes + \"--.\";\nstring middleLine = \"|  \" + message + \"  |\";\nstring bottomLine = \"*--\" + dashes + \"--*\";\n\nRun the code again, and verify that the box properly sizes to the message! Try updating the boxMessage variable in the Main method, and make sure the box resizes as needed.\nReceiving the Box Message from the Console\nThe usefulness of the boxify method is that it can boxify any message! Instead of hard-coding a message, ask the user for one.\nFirst, at the top of the body of the Main method, use Console.WriteLine to print the question to the console:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"What would you like to put in a box?\");\n\nThen, update the value of the boxMessage variable so that it is set to Console.ReadLine:\nstring boxMessage = Console.ReadLine();\n\nFinally, add an extra Console.WriteLine underneath the string boxMessage line for some extra space:\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nRun the code again, and verify that it is possible to boxify any message entered!\nCalling the boxify Method on the Welcome Message\nOne final benefit to the boxify method is that the welcoming message can also be boxified! Create a new string variable named welcomeBox, and set it equal to the boxified welcome message. Then, write it to the console:\nstring welcomeBox = boxify(\"Welcome to the Boxifier!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(welcomeBox);\n\nRun the program one last time to see the ultimate power of the Boxifier!\nFinal Code\n\nRepl\n\n"},"Cs101ReviewPart2/MethodReviewPractice.html":{"url":"Cs101ReviewPart2/MethodReviewPractice.html","title":"Method Review Practice","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review: Method Practice\nFollow the instructions to review C# methods.\nBoxifier Enhancements\nAfter completing the Boxifier Code-Along, make the following enhancements:\n\nAdd some embellishment to the box!\nTry using ASCII art to make the box a little more interesting\n\n\nCreate multiple box types!\nAdd another parameter to the boxify method, and allow the user to decide which type of box to draw\n\n\nMake a menu-based Boxifier!\nUse a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for new text to boxify\n\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure\nCreate a Choose Your Own Adventure-style text-based game.

If the count says 10, there may be an off-by-one error!\nSquaring a Number\nOne interesting side effect for this list of perfect squares is that each item in the list is the square of its own index. For example, the item at index 0 in the list is 0, the item at index 4 in the list is 16, and so on. It is possible to use this list to calculate squares without having to do the math!\n\nIn the body of the Main method, beneath the count message, display a message asking the user which number they would like to square\nStore the number they enter as an int variable (num)\nDeclare a new variable that will hold the number squared\nSet the variable to the item in the squares list at position num\nDisplay a message to the user telling them the square value\nEx. If they enter 6, \"6 squared is 36\"\n\n\n\nExtra Challenges\nCustom Limit\nInstead of counting all the squares from 0-100, allow the user to enter the upper limit. Use the number they enter in the while loop instead of 100.\nBetter Error Handling\nWhen squaring a number, do not allow the user to square a number outside the range of the list. For example, if they wish to square the number 20, but there fewer than 21 items in the list, display a message saying \"Number not within range.\"\n"},"Collections/ToDoListChallenges.html":{"url":"Collections/ToDoListChallenges.html","title":"To-Do List Challenges","keywords":"","body":"To-Do List: Challenges\nComplete the following challenges building from the existing to-do list application.

When the program runs, it should repeatedly cycle through the frames of an animation. The end result should look something like this:\n\nHere are some things that may help accomplish this:\n\nA List of verbatim literal strings, each with one frame of the animation\nThe Console.Clear method to clear the console before drawing each frame\nAn infinite while loop, along with a variable to track the current frame for the animation (i.e., the spot in the List of strings)\nThe Thread.Sleep method to add time between each frame\nSome way to go back to the first frame of the animation after the last frame has been reached\n\nBonus Challenge 2: A List of Lists\nSometimes, it makes sense to represent data as a List of Lists in C#. This is sometimes referred to as a 2D (two-dimensional) collection.\nFor example, imagine a school attendance tracker. A teacher would like to keep track of which students are absent each day. For a given day, there is a List of string objects, each of which contains the name of an absent student. All of these lists are stored in another List, which contains all of the information across all of the days.\nThe type of the List, instead of being something like int or string, is List because the list contains List objects! It ends up looking like this:\nList> attendanceDays = new List>();\n\nCreate a program that allows a teacher to keep track of the absences across multiple days. This should be a menu-based application. The teacher should be able to do the following:\nAdd a new daily entry to the main List\nCreate a new List object for the current day, and add it to the List>.\nView the entire list of absences\nPrint out each day of absences. Note that if the list is empty for a given day, \"(no absences)\" should be printed.\nIt should end up looking something like this:\n--Day 1--\nLucy\nShan\nDarius\n\n--Day 2--\nShan\n\n--Day 3--\nMario\nLucy\n\n--Day 4--\n(no absences)\n\n--Day 5--\nDarius\nFind the total number of absences for a given student\nLoop through each day of absences, and keep track of how many times the student's name appears.\nSide-Note: Wikipedia List of lists of lists\nThere is an impressively comprehensive list on Wikipedia that contains lists of other lists.\n"},"Collections/BasicPractice.html":{"url":"Collections/BasicPractice.html","title":"Basic Practice","keywords":"","body":"Basic List Practice\nComplete the following exercises related to List objects.\nExercise 1: Bugs\nVisit each of the following Repls.

For example, instead of writing THE VOID, they might write T H E   V O I D. Create a program that allows the user to input some text, and gives them the \"spaced\" version of that text!\nBackground - string Objects\nFor this to work, it is important to know that a string object can actually be treated as a List of char objects. A char is just like a string, only it contains one single character instead of multiple characters. This means that, given a string variable named myString it is possible to do something like this:\nforeach (char c in myString)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(c);\n}\n\nThe code above would print out each individual character in the string!\nImplementation\nFollow the steps below to implement the \"Spaced Out Text\" program.\n\nCreate a new project in Repl\nIn the body of the Main method, print out a message that says \"Enter some text to space out\"\nUnder that, create a new string variable named text\nSet the text variable to the result of Console.ReadLine()\nUnder that, create another string variable named spacedText\nThis will hold the \"spaced out\" text\n\n\nSet the spacedText variable to be an empty string (\"\")\nUnder that, create a foreach loop that will loop through each char c in the text string   foreach (char c in text) { }\n\n\nIn the body of the foreach loop, add c and an extra space to the spacedText variable   spacedText += c + \" \";\n\n\nUnder the foreach loop, print out the final spacedText value\n\nRun the program. Make sure it is possible to enter some text, and see the spaced out version of it!\nExercise 4: Course Ranking\nThink about all of the courses you take in school. Order them by how much you like them, with number 1 being the top course. Create a program that will allow the user to check which course corresponds with each ranking.\n\nCreate a new project in Repl\nAt the top of the file, add using System.Collections.Generic;\nIn the body of the Main method, print out a message that says \"Course Ranking\"\nUnder that, initialize a new List object named courses   List courses = new List();\n\n\nUnder that, add each of your courses in order, with the top course coming first   courses.Add(\"Geometry\");\n // etc\n\n\nUnder that, use Console.WriteLine to ask the user which ranking they would like to see\nUnder that, create a new int variable named rank\nSet the rank variable to Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())\nUnder that, create a new int variable named rankIndex, and set it to rank - 1\nNote that this is necessary because List objects start index at 0\n\n\nOn the next line, create a new string variable named courseAtRank\nSet the courseAtRank variable to the element of the list at the rankIndex index   string courseAtRank = courses[rankIndex];\n\n\nOn the next line, print out the value of the courseAtRank variable\n\nRun the program and verify that the proper courses appear based on what the user enters!\nBonus - Limited Ranking\nCurrently, if the user enters something outside of the range of the course ranking list, the program will fail. Update it so that it checks whether the rank the user enters is within range. If it is not, display a message saying \"Course Ranking Not In Range.\"\n"},"ForLoops/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ForLoops/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 5 - For Loops","keywords":"","body":"For Loops\nLearn about another way to loop: the for loop.

The computer moves too fast! It is actually possible to slow it down using the Thread.Sleep method. This will stop program execution for a given amount of time. This can be very helpful for programs that deal with timing of any kind.\n\nAt the top of the file, add using System.Threading;\nIn the body of the for loop, make a new line\nAdd Thread.Sleep(1000); to wait for 1000 ms (one second) before continuing\n\nRun the program, and make sure the countdown is slowed down!\nExercise 3: Triangle of Zeroes\nCreate a program that can print a triangle consisting of powers of 10. It should ask the user how tall the triangle should be, and then print it out. This will be possible using the Math.Pow function to calculate each power of 10.\nExamples\nIf the user entered 3, the program should print:\n1\n10\n100\nIf the user entered 5, the program should print:\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n\nNote: This will not work for large inputs, because C# will truncate the numeric output\n\nImplementation\nFollow the steps below to implement the program.\n\nCreate a new project in Repl\nIn the body of the Main method, print out a message that says \"How tall of a triangle?\"\nUnder that, create a new int variable named height\nSet the height variable to Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine())\nUnder that, create a for loop   for () { }\n\n\nFor the first part of the for loop (initializer), create an int i variable and set it to 0   for (int i = 0;) { }\n\n\nFor the next part (conditional), check if i is less than the height variable   for (int i = 0; i \n\nFor the final part (modifier), increase the value of i by 1 with i++   for (int i = 0; i \n\nIn the body of the for loop, create a new double variable named power\nSet the power variable to Math.Pow(10, i)\nThis will calculate the power of 10 for the given index\n\n\nUse Console.WriteLine to print out the value of the power variable\n\nRun the program, and verify that it properly prints out some triangles!\nExercise 4: Rainbow Road\nCreate a program that will print out a road that changes colors as it goes. This will be possible using a List of ConsoleColor values. Create a new Repl, and remove any code from the body of the Main method to get started.\nThe List\nFirst, create a new List of ConsoleColor values containing the colors of a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. For convenience, the code for that is here:\nList colors = new List()\n{\n    ConsoleColor.Red,\n    ConsoleColor.DarkYellow,\n    ConsoleColor.Yellow,\n    ConsoleColor.Green,\n    ConsoleColor.Blue,\n    ConsoleColor.Magenta\n};\n\nMake sure to add using System.Collections.Generic; so the List works properly!\nThe Road\nFollow the steps below to create the rainbow road.\n\nUnder the colors list, create a for loop that will loop through 15 times for (int i = 0; i \n\nIn the body of the for loop, print out the text |  ||  |\nRun the program, and verify that a colorless road appears in the console\nBack in the for loop body, make some new lines above the Console.WriteLine statement\nAt the top of the for loop body, create a new int variable named colorIndex\nSet the colorIndex variable to i % colors.Count\nThis will allow the road to cycle through the colors multiple times\n\n\nOn the next line, create a new ConsoleColor variable named currentColor\nSet the currentColor variable to the value in the colors list at colorIndex   ConsoleColor currentColor = colors[colorIndex];\n\n\nUnder that, set the Console.ForegroundColor value to currentColor   Console.ForegroundColor = currentColor;\n\n\n\nRun the program again, and verify that a rainbow road appears!

It works pretty well, but there are some improvements to be made in the code. Refactor the program so that it uses a Movie class, and tracks one List of Movie objects instead of two lists.\nNote that the goal of this exercise is NOT to change the functionality of the application; it should still work in the same way. The goal is to improve the architecture, to make it easier to maintain.\nThe Current App\nVisit the Repl for the app so far, and try to figure out how it works. There are a few important features:\n\nTwo Lists: one that stores movie titles, and one that stores movie release years\nA while loop that infinitely displays the menu for the application\nAn \"Add Movie\" command that adds a movie title and year to the respective Lists\nA \"View Movies\" command that displays information about each movie\n\nSo, what's wrong with the way it works now? It seems to be functioning properly, but it could be organized in a simpler way. Separating some code into another class makes it easier to separate concerns for the app, and it also makes it easier to add features. The way it currently works, with two separate lists, is a little fragile. If those lists somehow become desynchronized, the data would not match up. Additionally, a whole new list would have to be created to store an additional piece of information about a movie (e.g. its rating, its Rotten Tomatoes score, or anything else). For these reasons, it makes a lot of sense to create a new class!\nHere is the plan:\n\nCreate a class named Movie\nAdd a Title and Year field to the Movie class\nUpdate the main code so that it creates a List of Movie objects instead of two separate lists\nUpdate the adding code so that it creates a new Movie object, sets the fields properly, and adds it to the list\nAdd a method on the Movie class to print out a movie in the proper format\nUpdate the viewing code so that it uses a foreach loop to go through each Movie object and print it\n\nLet's get started!\nCreating the Movie Class\nCreate a new file in the current folder named Movie.cs. This file will contain the Movie class.\n\nAt the top of the file, add using System;\nUnder that, define the Movie class with public class Movie {}\nWhat should the Movie class contain? What pieces of data are stored for each movie? So far, the app stores a title, and a year. Add those as fields for the movie\n\nMovie.cs\nusing System;\n\npublic class Movie\n{\n    public string Title;\n    public int Year;\n}\n\nThat's all that's needed to start working with the Movie class and creating Movie objects.\nUsing the Movie Type: Adding Movie Objects\nConsolidate the two Lists that store movie information into one: a List of Movie objects!\nFirst, remove the two existing List variables, and create a new List named movies. Everything looks the same as any other List, only with Movie as the type:\nList movies = new List();\n\nNext, when adding a movie, update the code so that it creates a new Movie object. For the new Movie object, set the Title and Year fields to be whatever the user entered, and add the new movie to the movies list.\nMovie movie = new Movie();\nmovie.Title = newTitle;\nmovie.Year = Convert.ToInt32(newYear);\n\nmovies.Add(movie);\n\nFor now, comment out the for loop code for viewing movies so the code will work without an error. Run the program, and make sure movies can be added! Obviously, adding movies doesn't do much good if they cannot be viewed.\nUsing the Movie Type: Viewing Movie Objects\nBefore, the code used a for loop and printed out the title and year from the separate lists. Now that the Movie class exists, the actual printing can be done there instead! This helps separate concerns, and makes the code easier to read.\nIn the Movie.cs file, add a new method named Print to the Movie class. It should be public, and have a return type of void:\npublic void Print()\n{\n\n}\n\nNote that there is no static keyword used! This is because this method will use the fields on the class. Copy the code from the original for loop into the body of the method, and update the variable names so that they use the fields instead:\nConsole.WriteLine($\"{Title} ({Year})\");\n\nNow, find the \"View Movies\" code where the for loop is commented out. Remove the for loop, and replace it with a foreach loop. This should loop through each Movie object in the movies list:\nforeach (Movie m in movies)\n{\n\n}\n\nIn the body of the foreach loop, all that's needed is to call the Print method on the current Movie!\nm.Print();\n\nRun the program, and verify that the current movie watchlist can be viewed!\nAdding a Rating field\nTo illustrate the usefulness of classes, add an additional field to the Movie class: Rating.\n\nIn the Movie.cs file, add a new public string field to the Movie class\nIn the Print method, update the message so that it includes the Rating value\nIn the main.cs file, when adding a movie, ask the user for a rating\nSet the Rating property on the new Movie object to reflect what the user entered\n\nThat's all that's needed! The \"View Movies\" code does not need to be updated, and a new List does not need to be created. This makes the Movie Watchlist application much easier to maintain!\n"},"Classes/RestaurantClass.html":{"url":"Classes/RestaurantClass.html","title":"Restaurant Class Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Restaurant Class\nYou are approached by a company in the restaurant review business, and they need your help! They want to create a database of chain restaurants, but they don't know where to start. They are not sure what information they should track for each restaurant, and they also don't know how to implement a data model in C#. For whatever reason, YOU are the most qualified consultant they have, so you have to help them implement their Restaurant class!\nModeling\nFirst, think about what information is pertinent to a chain restaurant. What would this review business need to see for each restaurant in their database? Write out a table with whatever data columns you think make the most sense to store. The table should contain the attributes and their data types. It should look something like this (but for restaurants instead of dogs):\nExamples\nAs you create your table, consider some specific chain restaurants that the client could track. How would the data appear for those restaurants? Fill in data for at least three restaurants.\nImplementing\nOnce you have your table, create a real C# class definition! Write it out, making sure to include all of the data from the model. Call the class Restaurant. Try to make the class code as syntactically accurate as possible.\nExamples\nFor each example chain restaurant you modeled, write out how you would create a new object instance of the Restaurant class!

Each Animal has a name, a species, a height (in inches), and a certain number of legs. There is a method that prints this information to the console.\nMain Method\nFirst, the main method loops with a while loop, allowing the user to add new Animal objects to the List of animals. After adding animals, the program prints out the information for each Animal object.\nModifications\nThe goal of this activity is to add a constructor to the Animal class. The actual functionality should NOT change; this is an example of refactoring. This will simplify the code, and make it easier to maintain!\nCreating a Constructor\nIn the Animal.cs file, at the bottom of the class definition, add code for a new custom constructor. Remember, defining a constructor is like defining any other method, with two key differences:\n\nThe name of the constructor has to be the name of the class (in this case, Animal)\nThere is no return type for the constructor; instead of returning anything, it initializes a new object of the class type\n\nThe code looks like this:\npublic Animal()\n{\n\n}\n\nConstructor Parameters\nNow that the skeleton of the constructor has been defined, it's time to make it actually do something!\nDevelopers often use constructors to initialize fields or properties on a class object. To do this for the Animal class, add four parameters to the Animal constructor, each corresponding to one of the fields on the class. The parameters should have the same types as the fields, but they should NOT have the same name.\nThe code should look something like this:\npublic Animal(string name, string species, int legs, double heightInCm)\n{\n\n}\n\nSetting the Field Values in the Constructor\nNow that the constructor has some parameters, the constructor can use them to build the object. This is a lot like setting the field values outside of the constructor, but it makes it easier to initialize objects. In the body of the constructor, set each field to be the parameter value (except for the heightInCm parameter):\nName = name;\nSpecies = species;\nNumberOfLegs = legs;\n\nSetting the Height\nFor the HeightInInches property, things will be a little different. Although it is a little contrived, for this application, the user will always want to enter the height in centimeters, but have it stored in inches. Currently, the Main method converts the height from centimeters to inches before setting the HeightInInches property. Instead, it will be cleaner to do the conversion in the constructor!\nSince the height parameter is currently measured in centimeters, set the HeightInInches field to be the value of the heightInCm parameter multiplied by 0.39:\nHeightInInches = heightInCm * 0.39;\n\nNow the constructor is complete! That should be all the changes needed in the Animal.cs file.\nUsing the Constructor\nUpon running the project in its current state, an error should appear:\nThe type `Animal` does not contain a constructor that takes `0` arguments\nThis is caused by the following statement:\nAnimal a = new Animal();\n\nBecause the Animal class now has a custom constructor, the default constructor no longer exists! This means it is necessary to use the custom constructor when instantiating new Animal objects. Update the code in the main.cs file so that it properly utilizes the Animal constructor.\nPassing the Arguments\nNow, instead of taking zero arguments, the Animal constructor method takes four. Pass in the name, species, legNum, and heightCm values directly:\nAnimal a = new Animal(name, species, legNum, heightCm);\n\n\nNote that it is no longer necessary to convert the heightCm value to inches; that happens in the constructor.\n\nOnce this change has been made, remove the direct field setting statements below, as they are no longer required! At this point, the program should work again. Run it, and ensure that it works the same as it did before the changes!\n"},"ClassConstructors/Practice.html":{"url":"ClassConstructors/Practice.html","title":"Practice","keywords":"","body":"Classes Practice\nSpend some time practicing class concepts, including constructors.

Some of these bugs may not be immediately obvious: try testing out the programs to discover them. Make sure that everything functions properly by the end!\nThere should be a total of 6 bugs to find and fix, across both the main.cs file and the Fruit.cs file.\n\nHINT: Use the errors to guide the debugging process. Each error should point to the line number on which it occurs; start by finding the line, and then try to figure out what's wrong with it!\n\nFruit Stand: Enhancements\nOnce all of the bugs have been removed from the fruit stand, try adding the following enhancements!\nAdd Another Fruit to the Inventory\nCreate another Fruit object, and add it to the inventory List!

This can become a little unwieldy. Try to refactor the program so that there is a new class, ShoppingCart, that handles a lot of the functionality.\nThe ShoppingCart class should contain:\n\nA List for the inventory of the fruit stand\nA List for the current items in the cart\n\nThe ShoppingCart should be able to:\n\nCalculate the total price for the cart\nCalculate the total calories for the cart\nGet the count for a given item in the cart\nPrint out the contents of the cart, including total price and calories\n\nBy the end of the refactoring, the main.cs file should not contain any methods other than the Main method. This separation of concerns will make the program much easier to maintain in the future.\n"},"FinalProject/FinalProject.html":{"url":"FinalProject/FinalProject.html","title":"Week 9 - Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Final Project\nShow us what you learned!
