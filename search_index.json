Practice\n\n"},"Cs101Review/IllustratorCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Cs101Review/IllustratorCodeAlong.html","title":"Illustrator Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Illustrator Code-Along\nFollow the instructions below to build a simple menu-based application that can draw some ASCII art.\nPrinting the Welcome Message\nStart by printing out a message that says \"Welcome to the Illustrator!\"\nAfter the initial Console.WriteLine, add another empty Console.WriteLine statement just to add a space beneath the first message. Run the program and ensure that the message appears in the console.\nCode\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Illustrator!\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nPrinting the Menu\nNext, print out the menu for the application. It should start with another empty Console.WriteLine for some more space. It should then ask the user which command they would like to execute. To start, add one option for a command: \"1. Draw Bunny\". Add empty Console.WriteLine statements to make spaces between the messages where necessary. Run the program and ensure that the menu text appears as expected.\nCode\nConsole.WriteLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"What would you like to do?\");\nConsole.WriteLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"1. Draw Bunny\");\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nReceiving User Input\nOnce the user has been prompted, it is necessary to receive their input from the console.\n\nCreate a new string variable named command, and use Console.ReadLine to read the user's command from the console\nRepeat the command back to the user. For example, if they entered \"1\" as the command, the program should print \"You entered: 1\"\nAdd an empty Console.WriteLine to make some space\nRun the program, enter a command, and verify that it is properly remembered and repeated\n\nstring command = Console.ReadLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"You entered: \" + command);\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nExecuting the User Command\nNow that the command is known, it is time to execute it. Currently, it is only possible to execute one command: the \"1. Draw Bunny\" command. To start, print out the word \"bunny\" if the user entered \"1\" for the command.\n\nAfter the command is read from the user, add an if statement\nWithin the conditional for the if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"1\"\nIn the body of the if statement, use Console.WriteLine to write \"bunny\" to the console\nRun the program, and verify that \"bunny\" is printed if the command entered is \"1\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"1\")\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"bunny\");\n}\n\nUpdating the Bunny\nInstead of simply printing the word \"bunny\" to the console, the program should draw an ASCII art bunny. Use three Console.WriteLine statements to draw a bunny. Run the program to see the new bunny!\nCode\nConsole.WriteLine(\"() ()\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"(^ ^)\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"(___)\");\n\nAdding Another Command\nSo far, the program is not all that interesting. It can only execute one command! Add some code so that the program can execute another command: \"2. Draw Fish\"\n\nIn the menu section, add another Console.WriteLine to print out \"Draw Fish\" option: Console.WriteLine(\"2. Draw Fish\");\n\n\nUnder the existing if statement, create a new if statement\nIn this if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"2\"\nIn the body of this if statement, write code to print out a small ASCII fish\nRun the program, and verify that the fish is printed if the command entered is \"2\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"2\")\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"  _ \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\">\");\n}\n\nLooping the Process Infinitely\nCurrently, the program will run once, and then exit. However, to be a true menu-based application, the program should load the menu repetitively. Use a while loop to accomplish this.\n\nFind the first empty Console.WriteLine statement, above the one that says \"What would you like to do?\"\nRight above that statement, create a while loop\nSet the condition of the while loop to be true\nThis means the while loop will repeat infinitely!\n\n\nAdd the opening curly bracket immediately after the closing parenthesis for the while loop\nFind the end of the second if statement, and add the closing curly bracket for the while loop immediately following it\nIndent the code within the while loop so it is easier to read\nRun the program, and verify that the menu continuously re-appears!\n\nCode\nwhile (true)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"What would you like to do?\");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"1. Draw Bunny\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"2. Draw Fish\");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    string command = Console.ReadLine();\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    if (command == \"1\")\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"() ()\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"(^ ^)\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"(___)\");\n    }\n\n    if (command == \"2\")\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"  _ \");\n        Console.WriteLine(\">\");\n    }\n}\n\nAdding an Exit Command\nTo ensure that the program does not actually run forever, add an additional \"3. Exit\" command.\n\nIn the menu section, add another Console.WriteLine to print out \"Exit\" option: Console.WriteLine(\"3. Exit\");\n\n\nUnder the existing if statement, create a new if statement\nIn this if statement, check if the command variable is equal to \"3\"\nIn the body of this if statement, add a break command that will break out of the while loop\nRun the program, and verify that the program exits if the command entered is \"2\"\n\nCode\nif (command == \"3\")\n{\n    break;\n}\n\nFinal Code\n\nRepl\n\n"},"Cs101Review/BasicReviewPractice.html":{"url":"Cs101Review/BasicReviewPractice.html","title":"Basic Review Practice","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review: Basic Practice\nFollow the instructions to review some basic C# concepts.\nIllustrator Enhancements\nAfter completing the Illustrator Code-Along, make the following enhancements:\n\nAdd more command options to draw more ASCII art!\nCheck out this guide for help making ASCII art and using it in C#\n\n\n(BONUS) Instead of using if statements to run the commands, use a switch statement\n(BONUS) Define a method for each command, and call each method based on the user's selection\n\nFind the Bugs\nVisit each of the following Repls, and fix the errors in them.\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\n\nMulti-Page Story\nOften when reading something on a computer, the program will contain multiple pages instead of showing all the text at once. Create a C# application that will display a story, one passage at a time. It should end up looking something like this Frankenstein story by the end.\nUse Console.WriteLine to display the text from the story. Use Console.ReadLine to wait for the user to press Enter and continue. Use a while loop to loop through each passage of the story. Make sure to declare a counter variable to keep track of the current passage, and increment it every time through the loop.\nBonus Challenge - Word Breaking\nCurrently, using Console.WriteLine will add line breaks in the middle of words.\nFor example, it will show this:\nthe success of my und\nertaking.\nWhen it should show this:\nthe success of my\nundertaking.\nFix this by inserting a newline character (\\n) in the text for every place the line should break.\nBonus Bonus Challenge - Console Window Width\nTo make the newlines truly dynamic, measure the width of the console using Console.Window.Width. Use that value to determine where the newline characters should go. This way, it will properly keep words together regardless of the size of the console!\n"},"Cs101Review/AsciiArt.html":{"url":"Cs101Review/AsciiArt.html","title":"ASCII Art in C#","keywords":"","body":"ASCII Art in C#: Using Verbatim String Literals\nIt's a lot of fun to create ASCII art in C#, but there are a few issues that can arise with certain characters.\nLet's say we want to create a bat. We found a decent-looking ASCII art bat online, and it looks like this:\n  _   ,_,   _\n / `'=) (='` \\\n/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \n`      \"      `\nNow, we try to put that in C# with the following code:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"  _   ,_,   _   \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\" / `'=) (='` \\  \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"`      '      ` \");\n\nLooks good, right? But when we try to run it, we get a bunch of errors! What's happening here?\nEscape Sequences\nThe problem is that C# is on the lookout for escape sequences. Every time it sees a backslash (\\), it thinks we are trying to create a special character! Our bat contains several backslashes, so it gets tripped up. What we want to do is avoid these escape sequences, and treat the backslashes as regular text. How can we do that?\nVerbatim String Literals\nVerbatim string literals are a way to tell C# that we don't want to use any escape sequences, we just want the raw text. Instead of giving us errors, or converting our backslash sequences to other symbols, it will keep the text as-is.\nTo create a verbatim string literal, simply add an @ before the opening quote! Returning to our bat example, here's all we have to do to make it work:\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"  _   ,_,   _   \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\" / `'=) (='` \\  \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\ \");\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"`      '      ` \");\n\nAnother great thing about verbatim strings is that we can easily combine multiple lines! Instead of using the four Console.WriteLine statements above, we can use one Console.WriteLine statement that contains each line for the bat. All we have to do is make a new line in between the opening and closing double quotes. Make sure not to indent any of the text; since it's verbatim, those extra spaces will be in the final text!\nIt should look something like this:\nConsole.WriteLine(@\"\n  _   ,_,   _   \n / `'=) (='` \\  \n/.-.-.\\ /.-.-.\\\n`      '      `\n\");\n\nUsing verbatim string literals makes it much easier to work with ASCII art.

Just make sure to start your strings with an @ symbol!\n"},"Cs101ReviewPart2/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Cs101ReviewPart2/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 2 - C# 101 Review Continued","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review Continued\nFurther review of C# 101, with a focus on methods.\nCode-Along\n\nBoxifier Code-Along\n\nPractice\n\nMethod Practice\nBasic Practice (from the previous session)\n\n"},"Cs101ReviewPart2/BoxifierCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Cs101ReviewPart2/BoxifierCodeAlong.html","title":"Boxifier Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Boxifier Code-Along\nFollow the instructions below to create and use a method that encases a piece of text in an ASCII box.\nPrinting the Welcome Message\nStart by creating a new project and simply printing out a basic welcome message.\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Boxifier!\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nDefining the boxify Method\nThe goal of this program will be to have a method named boxify that places a custom message in a box. To start, have the method simply print out a box containing a static message.\nUnder the Main method, define a new method named boxify:\npublic static void boxify() { }\n\nThen, in the body of the boxify method, add three Console.WriteLine statements to print out the word \"Box\" surrounded by an ASCII art box:\nConsole.WriteLine(\".-------.\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"|  Box  |\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"*-------*\");\n\nFinally, call the boxify method from the Main method, under the other code:\nboxify();\n\nRun the program, and verify that the properly boxed message appears!\nReturning a string from the boxify Method\nTo make this more dynamic, the boxify method should return a string. This way, the code that calls the method can do anything with the result.\nStart by updating the method signature of the boxify method so that its return type is string instead of void:\npublic static string boxify()\n\nNext, in the body of the boxify method, move the three strings out of the Console.WriteLine statements, and into their own variables:\nstring topLine = \".-------.\";\nstring middleLine = \"|  Box  |\";\nstring bottomLine = \"*-------*\";\n\nFinally, combine the three string lines, separated by '\\n' characters, into a new string variable, and return it:\nstring entireBox = topLine + \"\\n\" + middleLine + \"\\n\" + bottomLine;\nreturn entireBox;\n\nUsing a Custom message Parameter for the boxify Method\nNow that the box message has been returned as a string, it's time to add the ability to customize the message. Instead of always putting \"Box\" in the box, the message will be determined by a parameter on the boxify method.\nFirst, update the method signature for the boxify method so that it contains a new string parameter of message:\npublic static string boxify(string message)\n\nThen, update the middleLine variable so that instead of containing \"Box\" it contains the custom message parameter\nstring middleLine = \"|  \" + message + \"  |\";\n\nEverything else should still work the same for now!\nUpdating the boxify Method Call with the string Argument\nThe boxify method has been updated quite a bit, but it appears to be broken when it is called from the Main method! This is because the boxify method takes an argument now, and the Main method needs to pass something into it.\nCreate a new string variable above the call to boxify, and pass it into the boxify method call:\nstring boxMessage = \"I am in a box\";\n\nboxify(boxMessage);\n\nAdditionally, it is important to save what is returned from the boxify method call! Create a new string variable named box, and update the code so that it stores the result in the variable:\nstring box = boxify(boxMessage);\n\nRun the code to make sure it works! It should look okay for some messages, but it also appears to be a little off.\nCalculating the Box Top and Bottom Dashes\nCurrently, the number of dashes on the top and the bottom of the box does not change with the message length. This means that the box does not look much like a box! Update the code in the boxify method so that it dynamically creates strings for the top and bottom dashes.\nAt the top of the body of the boxify method, create a new string variable named dashes, and set it to the empty string:\nstring dashes = \"\";\n\nThe dashes variable should eventually hold one dash for each character in the message. To accomplish this, set up a while loop:\nwhile ()\n{\n\n}\n\nIn the condition for the while loop, check that the length of dashes is less than the length of message:\nwhile (dashes.Length \nBasically, the loop should continue until the number of dashes matches the number of characters in the message. Next, in the body of the while loop, add a dash to the dashes variable:\ndashes += \"-\";\n\nNow that the proper dashes have been calculated, it's time to place them within the topLine and bottomLine variables. Remove the three - characters currently in the middle of the top and bottom lines, and replace them with the dashes variable:\nstring topLine = \".--\" + dashes + \"--.\";\nstring middleLine = \"|  \" + message + \"  |\";\nstring bottomLine = \"*--\" + dashes + \"--*\";\n\nRun the code again, and verify that the box properly sizes to the message! Try updating the boxMessage variable in the Main method, and make sure the box resizes as needed.\nReceiving the Box Message from the Console\nThe usefulness of the boxify method is that it can boxify any message! Instead of hard-coding a message, ask the user for one.\nFirst, at the top of the body of the Main method, use Console.WriteLine to print the question to the console:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"What would you like to put in a box?\");\n\nThen, update the value of the boxMessage variable so that it is set to Console.ReadLine:\nstring boxMessage = Console.ReadLine();\n\nFinally, add an extra Console.WriteLine underneath the string boxMessage line for some extra space:\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\nRun the code again, and verify that it is possible to boxify any message entered!\nCalling the boxify Method on the Welcome Message\nOne final benefit to the boxify method is that the welcoming message can also be boxified! Create a new string variable named welcomeBox, and set it equal to the boxified welcome message. Then, write it to the console:\nstring welcomeBox = boxify(\"Welcome to the Boxifier!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(welcomeBox);\n\nRun the program one last time to see the ultimate power of the Boxifier!\nFinal Code\n\nRepl\n\n"},"Cs101ReviewPart2/MethodReviewPractice.html":{"url":"Cs101ReviewPart2/MethodReviewPractice.html","title":"Method Review Practice","keywords":"","body":"C# 101 Review: Method Practice\nFollow the instructions to review C# methods.\nBoxifier Enhancements\nAfter completing the Boxifier Code-Along, make the following enhancements:\n\nAdd some embellishment to the box!\nTry using ASCII art to make the box a little more interesting\n\n\nCreate multiple box types!\nAdd another parameter to the boxify method, and allow the user to decide which type of box to draw\n\n\nMake a menu-based Boxifier!\nUse a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for new text to boxify\n\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure\nCreate a Choose Your Own Adventure-style text-based game.

It works pretty well, but there are some improvements to be made in the code. Refactor the program so that it uses a Movie class, and tracks a List of Movie objects instead of two lists.\nNote that the goal of this exercise is NOT to change the functionality of the application; it should still work in the same way. The goal is to improve the architecture, to make it easier to maintain.\nThe Current App\nVisit the Repl for the app so far, and try to figure out how it works. There are a few important features:\n\nTwo Lists: one that stores movie titles, and one that stores movie release years\nAn while loop that infinitely displays the menu for the application\nAn \"Add Movie\" command that adds a movie title and year to the respective Lists\nA \"View Movies\" command that displays information about each movie\n\nSo, what's wrong with the way it works now? It seems to be functioning properly, but it could be organized in a simpler way. Separating some code into another class makes it easier to separate concerns for the app, and it also makes it easier to add features. The way it currently works, with two separate lists, is a little fragile. If those lists somehow become desynchronized, the data would not match up. Additionally, a whole new list would have to be created to store an additional piece of information about a movie (e.g. its rating, its Rotten Tomatoes score, or anything else). For these reasons, it makes a lot of sense to create a new class!\nHere is the plan:\n\nCreate a class named Movie\nAdd a Title and Year field to the Movie class\nUpdate the main code so that it creates a List of Movie objects instead of two separate lists\nUpdate the adding code so that it creates a new Movie object, sets the fields properly, and adds it to the list\nAdd a method on the Movie class to print out a movie in the proper format\nUpdate the viewing code so that it uses a foreach loop to go through each Movie object and print it\n\nLet's get started!\nCreating the Movie Class\nCreate a new file in the same folder named Movie.cs. This file will contain the Movie class.\n\nAt the top of the file, add using System;\nUnder that, define the Movie class with public class Movie {}\nWhat should the Movie class contain? What pieces of data are stored for each movie? So far, the app stores a title, and a year. Add those as fields for the movie\n\nMovie.cs\nusing System;\n\npublic class Movie\n{\n    public string Title;\n    public int Year;\n}\n\nThat's all that's needed to start working with the Movie class and creating Movie objects.\nUsing the Movie Type: Adding Movie objects\nConsolidate the two Lists that store movie information into one: a List of Movie objects!\nFirst, remove the two existing List variables, and create a new List named movies. Everything looks the same as any other List, only with Movie as the type:\nList movies = new List();\n\nNext, when adding a movie, update the code so that it creates a new Movie object. For the new Movie object, set the Title and Year fields to be whatever the user entered, and add the new movie to the movies list.\nMovie movie = new Movie();\nmovie.Title = newTitle;\nmovie.Year = Convert.ToInt32(newYear);\n\nmovies.Add(movie);\n\nFor now, comment out the for loop code for viewing movies so the code will work without an error. Run the program, and make sure movies can be added! Obviously, adding movies doesn't do much good if they cannot be viewed.\nUsing the Movie Type: Viewing Movie objects\nBefore, the code used a for loop and printed out the title and year from the separate lists. Now that the Movie class exists, the actual printing can be done there instead! This helps separate concerns, and makes the code easier to read.\nIn the Movie.cs file, add a new method named Print to the Movie class. It should be public, and have a return type of void:\npublic void Print()\n{\n\n}\n\nNote that there is no static keyword used! This is because this method will use the fields on the class. Copy the code from the original for loop into the body of the method, and update the variable names so that they use the fields instead:\nConsole.WriteLine($\"{Title} ({Year})\");\n\nNow, find the \"View Movies\" code where the for loop is commented out. Remove the for loop, and replace it with a foreach loop. This should loop through each Movie object in the movies list:\nforeach (Movie m in movies)\n{\n\n}\n\nIn the body of the foreach loop, all that's needed is to call the Print method on the current Movie!\nm.Print();\n\nRun the program, and verify that the current movie watchlist can be viewed!\nAdding a Rating field\nTo illustrate the usefulness of classes, add an additional field to the Movie class: Rating.\n\nIn the Movie.cs file, add a new public string field to the Movie class\nIn the Print method, update the message so that it includes the Rating value\nIn the main.cs file, when adding a movie, ask the user for a rating\nSet the Rating property on the new Movie object to reflect what the user entered\n\nThat's all that's needed! The \"View Movies\" code does not need to be updated, and a new List does not need to be created. This makes the Movie Watchlist application much easier to maintain!\n"},"Classes/RestaurantClass.html":{"url":"Classes/RestaurantClass.html","title":"Restaurant Class Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Restaurant Class\nYou are approached by a company in the restaurant review business, and they need your help!

For whatever reason, YOU are the most qualified consultant they have, so you have to help them implement their Restaurant class!\nModeling\nFirst, think about what information is pertinent to a chain restaurant.

Each Animal has a name, a species, a height (in inches), and a certain number of legs. There is a method that prints this information to the console.\nMain Method\nFirst, the main method loops with a while loop, allowing the user to add new Animal objects to the List of animals. After adding animals, the program prints out the information for each Animal object.\nModifications\nThe goal of this activity is to add a constructor to the Animal class. The actual functionality should NOT change; this is an example of refactoring. This will simplify the code, and make it easier to maintain!\nCreating a Constructor\nIn the Animal.cs file, at the bottom of the class definition, add code for a new custom constructor. Remember, defining a constructor is like defining any other method, with two key differences:\n\nThe name of the constructor has to be the name of the class (in this case, Animal)\nThere is no return type for the constructor; instead of returning anything, it initializes a new object of the class type\n\nThe code looks like this:\npublic Animal()\n{\n\n}\n\nConstructor Parameters\nNow that the skeleton of the constructor has been defined, it's time to make it actually do something!\nDevelopers often use constructors to initialize fields or properties on a class object. To do this for the Animal class, add four parameters to the Animal constructor, each corresponding to one of the fields on the class. The parameters should have the same types as the fields, but they should NOT have the same name.\nThe code should look something like this:\npublic Animal(string name, string species, int legs, double heightInCm)\n{\n\n}\n\nSetting the Field Values in the Constructor\nNow that the constructor has some parameters, the constructor can use them to build the object. This is a lot like setting the field values outside of the constructor, but it makes it easier to initialize objects. In the body of the constructor, set each field to be the parameter value (except for the heightInCm parameter):\nName = name;\nSpecies = species;\nNumberOfLegs = legs;\n\nSetting the Height\nFor the HeightInInches property, things will be a little different. Although it is a little contrived, for this application, the user will always want to enter the height in centimeters, but have it stored in inches. Currently, the Main method converts the height from centimeters to inches before setting the HeightInInches property. Instead, it will be cleaner to do the conversion in the constructor!\nSince the height parameter is currently measured in centimeters, set the HeightInInches field to be the value of the heightInCm parameter multiplied by 0.39:\nHeightInInches = heightInCm * 0.39;\n\nNow the constructor is complete! That should be all the changes needed in the Animal.cs file.\nUsing the Constructor\nUpon running the project in its current state, an error should appear:\nThe type `Animal` does not contain a constructor that takes `0` arguments\nThis is caused by the following statement:\nAnimal a = new Animal();\n\nBecause the Animal class now has a custom constructor, the default constructor no longer exists! This means it is necessary to use the custom constructor when instantiating new Animal objects. Update the code in the main.cs file so that it properly utilizes the Animal constructor.\nPassing the Arguments\nNow, instead of taking zero arguments, the Animal constructor method takes four. Pass in the name, species, legNum, and heightCm values directly:\nAnimal a = new Animal(name, species, legNum, heightCm);\n\n\nNote that it is no longer necessary to convert the heightCm value to inches; that happens in the constructor.\n\nOnce this change has been made, remove the direct field setting statements below, as they are no longer required! At this point, the program should work again. Run it, and ensure that it works the same as it did before the changes!\n"},"ClassConstructors/Practice.html":{"url":"ClassConstructors/Practice.html","title":"Practice","keywords":"","body":"Classes Practice\nSpend some time practicing class concepts, including constructors.

Some of these bugs may not be immediately obvious: try testing out the programs to discover them. Make sure that everything functions properly by the end!\nThere should be a total of 6 bugs to find and fix, across both the main.cs file and the Fruit.cs file.\n\nHINT: Use the errors to guide the debugging process.

This can become a little unwieldy. Try to refactor the program so that there is a new class, ShoppingCart, that handles a lot of the functionality.\nThe ShoppingCart class should contain:\n\nA List for the inventory of the fruit stand\nA List for the current items in the cart\n\nThe ShoppingCart should be able to:\n\nCalculate the total price for the cart\nCalculate the total calories for the cart\nGet the count for a given item in the cart\nPrint out the contents of the cart, including total price and calories\n\nBy the end of the refactoring, the main.cs file should not contain any methods other than the Main method.
