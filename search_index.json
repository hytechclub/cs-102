Forking a repository allows you to freely make changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNote: Before forking a repository, make sure you have properly verified your GitHub email address\n\nForking the repository\n\nLogin to GitHub\nNavigate to the repository you'd like to fork (e.g., https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/YOUR_COURSE_REPOSITORY)\nClick the Fork button in the upper right \n\nThat's it! Now you have your own GitHub repository. It should look something like this:\n\nCreating your own repository\nIf you do not want to fork an existing repository, you can create a totally new one! In GitHub, click the plus icon in the upper right, and select New Repository:\nFill out some information, and you'll have your own repository!\n\nCloning the repository\nOnce you have your own repository, you can clone it on your local machine to play around with it!  A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere.\n\nOn the right side of your repository page, click the Clone or download button\nMake sure you are on the Clone with HTTPS menu\n\n\nClick the copy icon to copy your repository URL to your clipboard \n\nDepending on which tool you are using, follow the instructions in one of the sections below to complete the cloning process.\nCloning in Visual Studio Code\nIf you have installed Git on your machine, Visual Studio Code has built-in Git tools you can use.\n\nOpen Visual Studio Code\nPress Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette\nType in \">Git: Clone\" and press Enter to execute the command \nPaste in your repository URL and press Enter to confirm \nNavigate to a suitable location for your repository folder, and click the Select Repository Location button \nOnce your repository is cloned, a popup should appear in the lower right corner of the window. Click the Open Repository button to open a new instance of VS Code with the newly cloned repository\n \n\nCloning in Visual Studio\nIf you have Git installed on your machine, Visual Studio has built-in Git tools you can use.\n\nOpen Visual Studio\nOpen the Team Explorer pane \nClick the Manage Connections icon (plug) \nUnder \"Hosted Service Providers\", find \"GitHub\" and click Connect \nIn the window that pops up, enter your credentials and click Sign in \nUnder \"GitHub\", click Clone \nIn the window that pops up, select the repository you wish to clone\nClick Browse to find a proper folder in which to clone the repository\nClick Clone to begin the cloning process \n\nCloning via the Command Line\nIf you have Git Bash installed on your machine (or another shell), you can use that for all Git commands.\n\nOpen your shell application (e.g. Git Bash)\nChange your directory to wherever you'd like the repository to live cd /path/to/folder/\n\n\nUse the clone command to clone the repository (paste in the repository's url after clone) git clone https://github.com/YOUR_REPO_URL.git\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now you have a local clone of your repository.\n"},"Git/PushingAndPulling/PullChanges.html":{"url":"Git/PushingAndPulling/PullChanges.html","title":"Pull Changes","keywords":"","body":"Pull Changes\nWhen you want to retrieve changes from the server, you will have to pull those changes down. You can pull changes from your personal GitHub repository. If you forked another repository, you can also pull changes from the original repository (called the upstream repository).\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nWhen working with a forked repository, after pulling from the original upstream repository, you should push the changes up to your fork. This ensures that the upstream changes are also reflected in your personal server repository.\nPulling changes in Visual Studio Code\nPulling from your server repository\nVisual Studio Code has an interesting tool for pulling changes down from the remote repository. Instead of simply pulling changes, it actually synchronizes the local and remote repositories. This means that it pushes any commit changes up, and also pulls down any changes from the server that may exist.\nTo pull your changes down, use the Synchronize Changes button on the blue bar at the bottom of the window:\nOnce you click that button, your server changes should exist in your local clone! You can go to your repository on GitHub and make sure it matches your local repository.\nPulling from the original upstream repository\nThe easiest way to pull from the upstream repository is via the command line.\nTo open a command prompt within Visual Studio Code, select \"Terminal\" in the file menu, and the click \"New Terminal\":    \nThat should open a Git Bash terminal in the proper folder. Then, follow the instructions for pulling from the original upstream repository via the command line.\n\nPulling changes in Visual Studio\nPulling from your server repository\nVisual Studio has some nice built-in tools for pulling changes from the remote repository.\n\nOpen the Team Explorer pane \nUnder \"Project\", click Sync \nUnder \"Incoming Commits\", click Pull \nNote: To simply view incoming commits, but not merge them, you can click Fetch\n\n\n\nOnce you pull, your server changes should exist in your local clone! You can go to your repository on GitHub and make sure it matches your local repository.\nPulling from the original upstream repository\nAdding the upstream remote\nTo keep your fork up-to-date with the latest changes from the original repository, you will need to add an upstream remote. This will allow you to pull when new material is added to the original repository.\n\nIn the Team Explorer pane, click the \"Home\" icon to go home \nUnder \"Project\", click Settings \nUnder \"Git\", click Repository Settings \nIn Repository Settings, under \"Remotes\", click Add \nIn the \"Add Remote\" dialog, enter \"upstream\" for Name\nEnter the URL for the upstream repository for Fetch\nClick Save \n\nNow your upstream remote is all set up! In order to receive the latest changes from the original repository, you will have to fetch and merge from the upstream.\nFetching from the upstream remote\n\nIn the Team Explorer pane, click the \"Home\" icon to go home \nUnder \"Project\", click Sync \nIn Synchronization, at the top of the pane, click Fetch\nClick the dropdown and select \"upstream\"\nClick Fetch \n\nMerging from the upstream remote\n\nIn the Team Explorer pane, click the \"Home\" icon to go home \nUnder \"Project\", click Branches \nIn Branches, at the top of the pane, click Merge\nIn the \"Merge from branch\" dropdown, select \"upstream/master\"\nClick Merge \n\nNow you have the latest changes from the original upstream repository!\n\nPulling changes via the Command Line\nPulling from your server repository\nIf you're using the command line, pulling from your server repository is simple:\n\nChange your directory to the folder that contains your repository (replace /path/to/repository/ with your path)  cd /path/to/repository/\n\n\nRun the pull command git pull\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now your local clone repository should have all the latest changes from your GitHub repository.\nPulling from the original upstream repository\nPulling changes from the upstream repository is also fairly simple, assuming you do not have any conficting changes in your local repository.\nIf you are in the proper directory, all you have to do is run git pull with the URL of the upstream repository. Replace UPSTREAMREPOSITORYURL with the url of the original repository:\ngit pull https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/UPSTREAMREPOSITORYURL.git\n\nNow your local branch should contain all the latest changes from the upstream repository! \n"},"Git/PushingAndPulling/PushChanges.html":{"url":"Git/PushingAndPulling/PushChanges.html","title":"Push Changes","keywords":"","body":"Push Changes\nWhen you want to store a change on your remote repository, you will have to push those changes up.

First, make sure you have opened the proper root-level folder for your local repository clone.\nTo view the various source control options, click the Source Control icon on the left menu:\nThen, if you make a change to one of the files in your local repository, it will appear in the source control pane.\nStage (add) the changes for commit\nIf you have a change and you are ready to commit it, you first have to add or stage the change for commit. In the source control pane, click the plus icon next to the file to add it to the commit:\nCommit the change\nAfter you have added the change, it will be staged for commit. From there, you simply have to commit it!\n\nType a commit message in the box describing your change\nClick the checkmark icon to complete the commit \n\nOnce your change is committed, your local repository will include the change. The next step is to sync the change with the remote repository, so it's actually in GitHub.\nPush the change\nVisual Studio Code has an interesting tool for pushing changes up to the remote repository. Instead of simply pushing changes, it actually synchronizes the local and remote repositories. This means that it pushes any commit changes up, and also pulls down any changes from the server that may exist. For now, you'll only use the tool to push, but it works for pulling too.\nTo push your changes up, use the Synchronize Changes button on the blue bar at the bottom of the window:\nThe button should have a recycle/refresh symbol, a number and a down arrow, and another number and an up arrow. The down number corresponds with how many new commits exist on the server, and the up number corresponds with how many new commits exist in the local repository.\nOnce you click that button, you will have to enter your credentials. After that, your changes should exist in the server repository!

You can go to your repository on GitHub and make sure the changes are there.\nAdding, Committing, and Pushing via the Command Line\nFirst, make sure your present working directory is your repository's folder. Then, use the commands below to interact with git.\nStatus\nTo see the current status of your local repository, you can use the git status command:\ngit status\n\nAdd all changes in the repository\nThis command will take any changes you currently have, and stage them for commit:\ngit add .\n\nCommit all changes\nOnce all of your changes are staged for commit, you can use the git commit command to commit them. Replace COMMIT MESSAGE HERE with a message regarding your changes:\ngit commit -m \"COMMIT MESSAGE HERE\"\n\nPush all changes\nOnce your changes are committed, you can push them up to the server repository. Use the git push command to accomplish this:\ngit push\n\nNote: you will have to enter your credentials in order to push to the server repository.

For whatever reason, YOU are the most qualified consultant they have, so you have to help them implement their Restaurant class!\nModeling\nFirst, think about what information is pertinent to a chain restaurant. What would this review business need to see for each restaurant in their database? Write out a table with whatever data columns you think make the most sense to store. The table should contain the attributes and their data types. It should look something like this (but for restaurants instead of dogs):\nExamples\nAs you create your table, consider some specific chain restaurants that the client could track. How would the data appear for those restaurants? Fill in data for at least three restaurants.\nImplementing\nOnce you have your table, create a real C# class definition! Write it out, making sure to include all of the data from the model. Call the class Restaurant. Try to make the class code as syntactically accurate as possible.\nExamples\nFor each example chain restaurant you modeled, write out how you would create a new object instance of the Restaurant class! Remember, Restaurant is a type, and any specific Restaurant you create is an object. Set all of the proper data values for the class fields, and try to make the object instantiation code as syntactically accurate as possible.\nRestaurant abilities\nConsider what the client may want to do with these Restaurant objects.

Additionally, in the existing method for the \"Say Name\" button, create a Duck and call the SayName method.\nInheritance\nThere is a good article in the Microsoft documentation about inheritance in C#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance#background-what-is-inheritance\n\nInheritance is one of the fundamental attributes of object-oriented programming. It allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the derived class.\n\nWhat do each of our Animal classes have in common?\n\nHeight Property\nName Property\nSayName Method\n\nRather than repeating these properties and methods in each class, we can create one Base Class and have our animals inherit from it! Define the Animal class in a new Animal.cs file:\npublic class Animal\n{\n    public int Height;\n    public string Name;\n\n    public void SayName()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"My name is \" + Name);\n    }\n}\n\nNow, we should be able to remove the redundancies from our Dog and Duck classes. There's just one last thing we need to do: set up our classes to inherit from the Animal class. We do this using a colon (:) when after our class name:\npublic class Dog : Animal\n{\n    public string Breed;\n\n    public void Bark()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Bark\");\n    }\n\n    public Dog() { }\n\n    public Dog(string breed, int height, string name)\n    {\n        this.Breed = breed;\n        this.Height = height;\n        this.Name = name;\n    }\n}\n\n\nWhen reading your code, you can think of the colon to mean \"is a\" or \"is an.\" So, Dog : Animal would read \"Dog is an Animal\", Duck : Animal would read \"Duck is an Animal\", and so on.\n\nNotice that we can still set the Height and Name properties in the constructor, even though we aren't defining them in the Dog class! This is because they are coming from the Animal class, and Dog inherits from Animal.\nUpdating Duck\nWe can do the same thing for our Duck class, too. The program should function in the exact same way, but now it's much easier to add another Animal if we want. We can also update the Animal class, and all classes that inherit it will receive those updates.\n"},"Inheritance/IndividualInstructions.html":{"url":"Inheritance/IndividualInstructions.html","title":"Individual Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Individual Exercise - Even More Animals\nWe want our program to be able to represent other animals as well!\nFrogs\nOne animal we would like to represent in our program is Frogs.

Additionally, add the Frog to the \"Say Name\" button click, so that it will show a message with the Frog's name.\nAnother Animal\nThink of another animal we could represent in our code. Add a new class to represent that animal too! Try to think of some specific properties or methods the animal could have in addition to those provided by the base Animal class.

This means that a Dog is an Animal, and a Dog is ALSO an Organism (because an Animal is an Organism).\nTree\nNow that we represent organisms in our program, we can create more derived classes.

Remember how Dogs, Ducks, and Frogs were all derived from the Animal base class.\nPolymorphism\nOne of the really cool things about inheritance is that in our code, we can treat all derived class objects like their base class. This is because they follow an \"is a\" relationship, like so:\n\nA Dog is an Animal\nA Duck is an Animal\nA Frog is an Animal\n\nThis means we can have a List of Animals that contains Dogs, Ducks, and Frogs! Here's an example:\n// Define a new List of animals\nList animals = new List();\n\n// Define some animals\nFrog frog = new Frog(4, \"Kermit\", false);\nDog dog = new Dog(\"Muppet\", 20, \"Rolf\");\nDuck duck = new Duck(9, \"Donald\");\n\n// Add the animals to the list\nanimals.Add(frog);\nanimals.Add(dog);\nanimals.Add(duck);\n\n// Loop through the list and call a method on the objects\nforeach (Animal a in animals)\n{\n    a.SayName();\n}\n\nOriginally, in the SayName_Button_Click method, we had a list of Dog objects. We would not be able to add Ducks or Frogs to that list, but if we use a List instead, we are able to add any class that inherits from Animal!\nNotice how, in the foreach loop, each element of the list is an Animal. When it calls the SayName method, it steps into the Animal class definition to execute the code there. Even though we know these elements are specific animals, the code treats them simply as Animals. This is called Polymorphism.\nThere is a good article in the Microsoft documentation about polymorphism in C#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/polymorphism\n\nAt run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. When this occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.\n\nIllustrating Polymorphism with a ListView\nMake the following updates to add a ListView to our application.\nIn Animal.cs, update the Height and Name fields to be properties instead of simply fields:\npublic int Height\n{\n    get;\n    set;\n}\n\npublic string Name\n{\n    get;\n    set;\n}\n\nIn MainWindow.xaml, remove the dog image and \"Speak\" buttons, and add a ListView named lvAnimals:\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    Say Name\n\n\nIn MainWindow.xaml.cs:\n\nCreate a new field - public ObservableCollection Animals;\nIn the MainWindow constructor\nInitialize the Animals collection\nCreate and Add some Animal objects\nSet the ItemsSource for the ListView to point to the collection\n\n\n\npublic ObservableCollection Animals;\n\npublic MainWindow()\n{\n    InitializeComponent();\n    Animals = new ObservableCollection();\n\n    // Define some animals\n    Frog frog = new Frog(4, \"Kermit\", false);\n    Dog dog = new Dog(\"Muppet\", 20, \"Rolf\");\n    Duck duck = new Duck(9, \"Donald\");\n\n    // Add the animals to the list\n    Animals.Add(frog);\n    Animals.Add(dog);\n    Animals.Add(duck);\n\n    lvAnimals.ItemsSource = Animals;\n}\n\n\nUpdate the SayName_Button_Click method to use the collection\n\nprivate void SayName_Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    // Loop through the list and call a method on the objects\n    foreach (Animal a in Animals)\n    {\n        a.SayName();\n    }\n}\n\nDoing More with Polymorphism\nSo far, we've seen the execution of a base class method on objects of the derived class with SayName. This method is defined on the base class, so it will work the same way regardless of which specific animal object calls it. But what if we wanted to do something different for each derived class?\nRight now, if we tried to call the Quack method on every element in the animals list, it would fail, because that method is specific to Ducks. Similarly, we are unable to call the Bark method on every Animal, because that is specific to Dogs. But really, these methods are performing the same action: Speak. What we really want is to be able to call a Speak method on any given Animal, and execute code specific to the derived class. We can!\nVirtual Methods and Override\nFrom the Polymorphism artice:\n\nBase classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of the virtual method. Thus in your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.\n\nIn our case, we'd like to replace the various \"Speak\"ing methods (Bark, Quack, and Ribbit) with a virtual method on the base class. Then, in the derived classes, we can override the virtual method so that each class does something different when its called. We can call this new method Speak.\nDefine the Speak method on the Animal class, using the virtual keyword to make it overrideable. On the Animal class, we don't have to put any code in the body of the Speak method.\npublic class Animal\n{\n    public int Height\n    {\n        get;\n        set;\n    }\n\n    public string Name\n    {\n        get;\n        set;\n    }\n\n    public void SayName()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"My name is \" + Name);\n    }\n\n    public virtual void Speak()\n    {\n        // Do nothing if the animal is not specific\n    }\n}\n\nNow that we have a virtual Speak method, we can override it in each of our derived classes! In fact, all we have to do is update our existing \"Speak\"ing methods. We want to change their name to Speak, and add the override keyword:\npublic class Frog : Animal\n{\n    public bool IsPoisonous;\n\n    public override void Speak()\n    {\n        MessageBox.Show(\"Ribbit\");\n    }\n\n    public Frog() { }\n\n    public Frog(int height, string name, bool isPoisonous)\n    {\n        this.Height = height;\n        this.Name = name;\n        this.IsPoisonous = isPoisonous;\n    }\n}\n\nDo this for each of the derived classes. Now, we are able to call Speak on any animal, and it will execute the specific implementation from the derived class.\nWe can illustrate this by adding a doubleclick event to our ListView. When the user doubleclicks a given item in the list, it should call the Speak method on the corresponding object. Create the event handler in MainWindow.xaml.cs:\nprivate void lvAnimals_MouseDoubleClick(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)\n{\n    Animal selectedAnimal = lvAnimals.SelectedItem as Animal;\n    if (selectedAnimal != null)\n    {\n        selectedAnimal.Speak();\n    }\n}\n\nand hook it up in MainWindow.xaml:\n\n\nDepending on which row the user clicks, a different override of the Speak method will run!\n"},"Polymorphism/AnimalPolymorphismIndividualExercises.html":{"url":"Polymorphism/AnimalPolymorphismIndividualExercises.html","title":"Animal Polymorphism Individual Exercises","keywords":"","body":"Animal Polymorphism - Individual Exercises\nUpdate the Animal list application to make it more robust.\nAdd animal weight\nThe users of the Animal list application would like to store each animal's weight in addition to the rest of their properties.\n\nCreate a new integer property on the Animal class: Weight\nHINT: This should be quite similar to the Height property\n\n\nAdd a weight parameter to each different animal class's constructors\nDog, Duck, and Frog should all set the Weight property when initializing\nUpdate the instantiation of the animal objects in MainWindow.xaml.cs with the new parameter\n\n\nIn MainWindow.xaml, add an additional GridViewColumn and bind it to the Weight property\n\nVerify that when running the program, the new column appears with the proper values.\nAdd new animals to the list\nThe users would like to fill out the list with some additional animals:\n\n\n\nType\nName\nHeight\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDog\nClifford\n200\n1000\n\n\nDuck\nDaffy\n5\n60\n\n\nFrog\nJeremiah\n3\n15\n\n\n\nFor each of the animals listed above, in the MainWindow() constructor in MainWindow.xaml.cs:\n\nInstantiate a new animal object\nAdd the object to the Animals list\n\nVerify that when running the program, the new animals appear with the proper values.\nNew window\nWhen the user clicks a row within the ListView, instead of calling the Speak method, the program should open a new window with information about the animal.

TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1) specifies that the animation should take one second. BeginAnimation applies the animation to the center property of the ellipse geometry.\nRun the program to see the the animation in action!\nEasing Functions\nCurrently, the circle will move from one point to another in a linear speed. However, it is possible to specify the way the circle moves using an Easing function.\nSet the EasingFunction property to ease in a circlular speed:\nmyPointAnimation.EasingFunction = new CircleEase();\n\nLoad up the program again to see how the circle's movement changes.\nA Square Easing Function\nThere are some easing functions already built in to .NET, but we can also define our own thanks to interfaces. All we have to do is create a new class and implement the IEasingFunction interface! The Ease function for the interface takes in a double from 0-1 (representing time), and returns a position in the animation. For example, the linear function would simply return the argument it is given. But we can make the animation move however we want!\nCreate a new file, SquareEase.cs, and create a class that implements IEasingFunction. Remember, implementing an interface looks just like inheriting from a class; use : followed by the name of the interface. Then, click on the class name, and press Ctrl+.. This will allow you to quickly implement the interface!\nIn the Ease function, return the argument given multiplied by itself. This way, it will start slowly, and then speed up towards the end in a parabolic trajectory. It looks like this:\n\n\nNote: This is not the path the movement will take, but the speed. The circle will still move in a straight line, but it will start slowly and then accelerate.\n\nSet the EasingFunction for the PointAnimation so that it uses the new SquareEase class. We can use our new class because it is an IEasingFunction!\nA Slow-Fast Easing Function\nTo make a new type of easing function, we have to create a new class and implement IEasingFunction again.\nCreate a new file, SlowFastEase.cs, and create a class called SlowFastEase. Implement the IEasingFunction interface. In the Ease function, make it so that if the normalized time argument is under .75, the value returned is the argument divided by 5. Otherwise, return 3.4 * normalizedTime - 2.4. Note that this is like a piecewise-function: it specifies a continuous movement from 0-1. It will look like this:\n\nSet the EasingFunction for the PointAnimation so that it uses the new SlowFastEase class.\nOther Built-In IEasingFunction types\nThough we can make our own easing function implementations, there are a good number that already exist: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/easing-functions\nCheck out BounceEase and ElasticEase for some interesting ones!\nSetting the Easing Function Dynamically\nInstead of hard-coding an Easing Function for the animation, it would be cool to have a few buttons on the page that would allow the user to select the Easing Function.\n\nCreate a new field on the MainWindow class to store an IEasingFunction\nIn the myCanvas_MouseLeftButtonDown, set the EasingFunction for the PointAnimation to whatever is stored in the field\nCreate at least three buttons in the XAML that will set the value of the field to another easing function\n\nOnce complete, test out your program. You should be able to click the buttons, and then click around to see the different easing functions in action!\nUpdating an Easing Function\nOne of the cool things about creating our own IEasingFunction classes is that we can make them do whatever we want. We can add methods, properties, and constructors just like any other class!\n\nFor the SlowFastEase class, add a new double property called SlowTime\nThis will determine the time at which the animation flips from slow to fast\n\n\nCreate a new constructor for the class that sets the SlowTime property with the value of a parameter\nIn the Ease method, update the code so that instead of flipping from slow to fast at .75, it does so at SlowTime\nAdjust the equation so that it accelerates to the proper speed, and reaches (1, 1) continuously\nYou will need to do some math like this: http://www.coolmath.com/algebra/08-lines/12-finding-equation-two-points-01\nFor example, if the user wants SlowTime to be .6:\nThe two points will be (1, 1), and (0.6, 0.6/5)\nThe slope will be:\n(1-(0.6/5))/(1-0.6)\n.(1-0.12)/0.4\n0.88/0.4\n2.2\n\n\nThe y-intercept will be:\n1 = (2.2)(1) + b\nb = 1 - 2.2\nb = -1.2\n\n\nThe full equation will be 2.2x - 1.2\n\n\nYour Ease function should be able to properly handle any SlowTime between 0 and 1\n\nNow, you can try out different SlowFastEase objects with varying SlowTimes! The beauty here is that we can specify different animations with one IEasingFunction class, because interfaces allow for that flexibility. Add a couple more buttons that will set the easing function to SlowFastEase with different SlowTime values.\nAnother Ellipse\nAdd another ellipse to the canvas, with a different color and size. It should behave similarly to the first ellipse, but should move with a different easing function. It should also move to a different position, instead of directly where the mouse clicked.\nMore Animations\nTry to animate some additional shapes with different types of easing functions. Try to make some of the animations trigger on different key presses. Note that animating other types of shapes will not work like ellipses; not all shapes have a Center property. Try to find other ways to animate the additional shapes!\nResources\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/easing-functions\nhttp://www.coolmath.com/algebra/08-lines/12-finding-equation-two-points-01\nhttps://www.desmos.com/calculator\nhttp://gizma.com/easing/#quad1\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9349930/how-to-draw-a-circle-and-move-it-as-an-animation-in-c-sharp-wpf\n\n"},"FinalProject/FinalProject.html":{"url":"FinalProject/FinalProject.html","title":"Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Final Project\nMinimum Technical Requirements\n\nRequires user input\nShould take and respond to user input\nShould behave differently based on the user input\n\n\nExample of classes (at least 3)\n\nMainWindow does NOT count as one of the 3 classes\nUse inheritance\nUse either collection or instance of the base class type to interact with the child types as if they are the base class (Polymorphism).
