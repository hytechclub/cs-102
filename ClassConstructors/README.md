# Class Constructors
Introduce constructors, an important feature of C# classes. This session is also focused on review of class concepts.

## Warm up
Pose the following question to the students for review:

>What is a C# class?

## Lecture
Present the [Constructors](Constructors.pptx) PowerPoint to introduce the concept of constructors.

## Zoo Manifest Code-Along
Walk through the [Zoo Manifest code-along instructions](ZooManifestCodeAlong.md) to show the usefulness of constructors. The activity starts with a class that has no constructor, and shows how adding a constructor can make it easier to use.

## Final Project Introduction + Practice
First, introduce the final project. This way, the students will have an idea of what they are building toward for the remainder of the session. Any exercises they complete should be in service of their final project.

After that, give the students a chance to work on the [practice](Practice.md) exercises. These build on the practice from the previous session, and give students an opportunity to strengthen their skills.

## Kahoot Quiz
Toward the end of the session, play through the [Kahoot quiz](https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/2653107d-300c-43c5-8791-9531cc0f959a) that covers class concepts.
