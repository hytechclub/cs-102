# Additional Challenges
Complete the following challenges.

## Even Numbers in a List
1. Create a new integer `List` with 5 values
1. Set each of the `List` values to the first 5 even numbers
1. Print them out to the Console

## List of Names
1. Create a new `List` of strings
1. Add these names to the list: Alice, Bob, Charles, Danielle, Edgar and Frannie
1. Ask the user to add another name to the list
1. Ask the user for a name to check if it in the list
1. Use a `foreach` loop to check if the name is in the list
1. Tell the user if the name is in the list or not

## Create a Collection of the First 100 Fibonacci Numbers
Recall that the Fibonacci series is defined by the the nth number is the sum of the two previous:
```
f[n] = f[n-1] + f[n-2]  => 0,1,1,2,3,5 ...
```
Use this information to find and store the first 100 fibonacci numbers.

1. Start with `0` and `1` as the first two numbers
1. Find the next by adding the first two together
1. Ask the user for a number between `1` and `100`
1. Print the fibonacci number of the number provided

## Check if a String is a Palindrome
A palindrome is defined as follows:
>A group of characters that is the same forward as it is backwards. Palindromes normally do not take into account letter casing, spaces or punctuation.

Examples of some palindromes:
- Tacocat
- Hannah
- Kayak
- Never odd or even
- Rats live on no evil star
- (EXTRA CHALLENGE) A man, a plan, a canal - Panama!

Write a program that does the following:
1. Asks the user to enter in a word or phrase
1. Checks to see if this string is a palindrome
    - If it is a palindrome, print out "Yes"
    - Otherwise, print out "No"
