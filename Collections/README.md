# Collections (Arrays & Lists)
Introduce collections (mostly focused on `List`s).

## Overview
Collections allow users to store multiple like values within a single object. Two common types of collections will be discussed: arrays and `List`s.

### Difference Between Arrays and `List`s
Think of an array as a container with a certain number of slots in a certain order. The user has the ability to place an object in one of the slots, and at any given time retrieve or replace an object in a specific slot. Arrays store values of the same data type, so an array can store multiple integers or multiple strings (or any data type). The **size** of the array (the number of items it can hold) must be determined at creation, and it is impossible to modify the length of an array after that.

`List`s, on the other hand, are a little different. They have many of the same advantages as arrays, but it is possible to modify the number of items a `List` holds. The main disadvantage of a list is that it works a little slower than an array; in something like game development or streaming, when every millisecond counts, arrays are often used over lists for this reason.

## Warm Up
Pose the following question to the students:

>What are some things you might store in a list?

Use [this Quizizz question](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5f6a0d78c2a344001b1f9b57/what-s-in-a-list) to let the students answer.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces both arrays and lists. The emphasis is on `List`s (they are more useful in modern programming).

## Kahoot Quiz
The Kahoot quiz covers the content from the lecture: https://create.kahoot.it/share/c-101-collections/e1438fe4-431a-4fb0-9aaa-7d1b431852c7

## To-Do List Code-Along
Complete the [To-Do List Code-Along](ToDoListCodeAlong.md) activity as a group.

## To-Do List Individual Updates
Students complete the [To-Do List Individual Exercises](ToDoListIndividual.md) on their own.

## Challenges
### Square Count Challenge (Less Challenging)
This challenge tasks the students with creating a program to count the number of squares between 0-N.

### To-Do List Challenge (More Challenging)
This challenge tasks the students with updating the to-do list application.

### Additional Challenges (?)
Further challenges for the students.

## Practice Session
For an additional [practice session](ListsPractice.md), the students should work on some basic practice and continue working on the challenges. It may also be beneficial to play a review game of some sort.

### Baamboozle Team Quiz
Split the room up into two teams, and play this [baamboozle quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/138478). Make sure the students are **not** able to see the game code in the URL at any point. The answers are publicly available online, so if they see the game code, the students may be able to cheat.
