# To-Do List: Challenges
Complete the following challenges building from the existing to-do list application. These challenges will require some additional research about C# Lists.

## Clear list command
Add a command to the application that allows the user to clear the entire to-do list.

## Order items
When viewing the list, display numbers instead of dashes, like so:
```
1. Item One
2. Item Two
3. Item Three
```

## Remove items
Add a command to the application that allows the user to remove items from the to-do list.

## Reorder items
Add a command to the application that allows the user to reorder the existing items in the list.

## High importance items
Allow the user to specify whether or not an item is of high importance. When the user views the list, print the high importance items in red.

## Storing/loading items in a text file
When exiting the program, store the to-do list in a text file. When opening the program, load the existing to-do list from the same text file.
