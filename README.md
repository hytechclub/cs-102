## Virtual Semester
Use [repl.it](https://repl.it) instead of Visual Studio for a virtual semester. This will prevent the need for Git.

## GitHub Use
### Student Repository
> [https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/htc-cs-102](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/htc-cs-102)

This repository will be accessible to the students. The students will **fork** the repository, and instructors will push **code** to the repository. It should _not_ have instructions for activities; that will be in the Student GitBook.

### Instructor Repository
This is the instructor repository. It has all of the **lesson plans** for the semester, including the student facing material and solutions.

### Student GitBook
The student gitbook will be built from the Instructor Repository. It will include instructions for activities, along with resources.
