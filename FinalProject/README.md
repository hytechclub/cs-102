# Overview
Kick things off with a quick review quiz, and then let the students work on their projects.

## Review Quizizz
Have the students complete the [Final Review Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5f4e2c1292683d001caeda01/c-final-review). There are several options to play around with, such as a "Team" quiz option. Make sure the "Shuffle answer options" setting is off, but other than that, try to make it fun for everyone!

Once a student completes the quiz, they can begin working on their final project (even if the entire class has not completed it yet).

## Final Project
The remainder of the session will be devoted to final project work. The final project should have been introduced in the previous session.
