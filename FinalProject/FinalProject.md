# Final Project
Show us what you learned! Create anything you desire in C#, following the guidelines below. The project should reflect about 4 hours of work (or more), so make sure to scope it appropriately.

## Ideas
You can do whatever you want for your final project as long as it meets the requirements. However, if you'd like a good starting point, you can try one of the ideas below:

### Mini Database of some sort
Create a simple menu-based application to create, view, update and delete data objects. These objects can be anything, such as:

- Animals (like a Zoo)
- Food (Like a Restaurant)
- Songs (like Spotify)
- Movies (like IMDb)

### Pet Match App
Create an application that allows a user to enter some information about themselves, and then matches them up with a pet based on the information they entered.

### Console-Based Game
Create a console-based game. This could be a text adventure, or a more interactive game where the player can move a text-based character around on the screen.

#### Game Ideas
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Tic Tac Toe
- Hangman
- Choose Your Own Adventure game
- RPG-style game

## Project Plan
Each student should create a new Repl project that includes a text file. The text file should outline your plan for your project with as much detail as possible. What should the user experience be like? How will the architecture look? What are some potential challenges? Try to answer all of those questions and more in your planning document.

## Minimum Technical Requirements
The project should include:

- User input of some kind
- At least one new `class` (other than the main one)
- At least one `List`
- At least one `for` loop

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester. The presentation should include:

- Background about the idea behind the program
- An overview of the program's functionality
- An explanation of any new topics learned
- A brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code
- A discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development

### Procedure
- Students should store all of their code on Repl
    - Make sure the code is shared with the instructors
- If a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred
    - If a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone
    - If a student cannot share their screen, the instructor can show the student's project
- A student also has the option of recording a video presentation
- There will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present
- **If a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club**
