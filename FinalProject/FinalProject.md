# Final Project
Show us what you learned! Create anything you desire in C#, following the guidelines below. The project should reflect about 4 hours of work (or more), so make sure to scope it appropriately.

## Minimum Technical Requirements
The project should include:

- User input of some kind
- At least one `class`
- At least one `List`
- At least one `for` loop

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester. The presentation should include:

- Background about the idea behind the program
- An overview of the program's functionality
- An explanation of any new topics learned
- A brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code
- A discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development

### Procedure
- Students should store all of their code on Repl
    - Make sure the code is shared with the instructors
- If a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred
    - If a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone
    - If a student cannot share their screen, the instructor can show the student's project
- A student also has the option of recording a video presentation
- There will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present
- **If a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club**

## Ideas
You can do whatever you want for your final project as long as it meets the requirements above. However, if you'd like a good starting point, you can try one of the ideas below:

### Mini Database of some sort
Create a simple menu-based application to create, view, update and delete data objects. These objects can be anything, such as:

- Animals (like a Zoo)
- Food (Like a Restaurant)
- Songs (like Spotify)
- Movies (like IMDb)

### Pet Match App
Create an application that allows a user to enter some information about themselves, and then matches them up with a pet based on the information they entered.

### Console-Based Game
Create a console-based game. This could be a text adventure, or a more interactive game where the player can move a text-based character around on the screen.

#### Game Ideas
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Tic Tac Toe
- Hangman
- Choose Your Own Adventure game
- RPG-style game
