# For Loops
Introduce `for` loops.
 
## Warm Up
Pose the following question to the students:

>Why are loops useful? Why is it useful to avoid repeating code?

## For Loops Lecture
Introduce the syntax for `for` loops. Show the similarity to `while` loops, and walk through an example on the whiteboard (or a virtual whiteboard).

## FizzBuzz Code-Along
Follow the [FizzBuzz Code-Along instructions](FizzBuzzCodeAlong.md) as a group to create a FizzBuzz program.

## Sum Exercise
Students should follow the [Sum Individual instructions](SumIndividual.md) to complete the exercise.

## Challenges
There are several [challenges](ForLoopChallenges.md) for the students to complete.

## Practice Session
For an additional practice session, the students should continue working on the challenges. It may also be beneficial to play a review game of some sort.

### Bingo Game
Send students to the [Randomized Bingo Board](https://hylandtechclub.com/RandomizedBingoBoard.html) site so they can play. Go through the code questions in the [For Loop Bingo PowerPoint](ForLoopBingo.pptx), where each answer is a number between 1-24 (no repeats). Randomize the order of the questions before presenting the PowerPoint.

When students figure out an answer, they can mark it on their board. If they achieve a BINGO with properly verified answers, they win!
